#Transaction Data Compression
                          #Lossless Compression of Transactional Datasets
Introduction
  In today's data-driven world, efficient storage and processing of large datasets are paramount. Dataset compression, specifically lossless compression, offers a valuable     solution by reducing the physical size of data without compromising its integrity. This report explores the application of frequent itemset mining for lossless compression   of transactional datasets.

Problem Statement
  The goal is to compress a transactional dataset while ensuring that the original data can be fully reconstructed. This involves identifying patterns or commonalities 
  within the data to reduce redundancy.

Methodology
  1.Frequent Itemset Mining:
    Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm was employed to identify frequent itemsets within the dataset.
    Support Threshold: A support threshold of [insert threshold] was used to determine the significance of itemsets.
  
  2.Mapping Creation:
    Frequent Itemset Mapping: Frequent itemsets were mapped to unique identifiers.
    Mapping Optimization: The mapping was optimized to minimize the overall storage cost.
  
  3.Dataset Compression:
    Transaction Decomposition: Transactions were decomposed into their corresponding frequent itemsets.
    Identifier Substitution: The original itemsets were replaced with their identifiers.

Results
Compression Ratio: [insert compression ratio]
Storage Savings: [insert storage savings]
